2. Works from nine 'til five
3. Takes another train home again
4. Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

### A Total Conflict Game Between Sheena Easton and Her Baby


\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
 & Sheena Easton & Sheena Easton \\
 &  Stays Home & Goes to Baby's Work\\
\hline
{\bf Baby Home Again} & -100, {\bf 100} & {\bf 100}, 0 \\
{\bf Baby Stays at Work} & {\bf 50}, 0 & -100, {\bf 100} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a **zero-sum (total conflict) game**.

- Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern)
- Solution: **mixed strategy**
