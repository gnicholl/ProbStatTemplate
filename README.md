This Rmarkdown template is a modification of one of the templates from the `stevetemplates` package, and steve gets full credit.
I have simply made a handful of modifications to his package
based on personal preferences related to section numbering, paragraph spacing, citation/url highlighting, etc.
I have also added definitions for a bunch of latex math commands that I've found useful when writing about statistics/probability.
For instance, `\E{}` can be used to get the expectation operator.
