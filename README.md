This package includes modifications of the 'article' and 'beamer' templates from the `stevetemplates` package, and steve gets full credit.
I have simply made a handful of modifications to his templates
based on personal preferences related to section numbering, paragraph spacing, citation/url highlighting, width and placement of figure/table captions, etc.
I have also added definitions for a bunch of latex math commands that I've found useful when writing about statistics/probability. These have been collected and adapted from various stack exchange posts I've discovered over the years.
For instance, `\E{}` can be used to get the expectation operator.
You can find the full list of latex commands in the demo folder.
